# Stepping through life

### Your door keeps hitting the hallway
Put a shim on the element that connects the door with the doorway

### Your door makes creepy noises
Olive oil works

### Too big hole in your wall
Fill it with a tissue/Zewa and put some gypsum on it

### Never know whether the bathroom is being used or not
Construct a basic circuit with a LED and design it to light up when the door is locked üèÆ

### Your boss stalks you on GitHub
Pay for GitHub and make your repos private

### Your white Apple Watch band or iPhone Silicone Case becomes grayish
Clean it with Mr. Clean Magic Eraser (german: Meister Proper Schmutzradierer)

### Hate cleaning up when coming dead-tired home 
Clean as you go

### Hard to keep on track with stuff you want to do
Avoid saying "I think," and "I believe"

### Are you likely to forget a name
When someone tells you their name, say it out loud back to them. e.g. "It's nice to meet you John." You're far more likely to recall their name on your next meeting.
