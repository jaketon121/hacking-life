# Stepping through life

### Your door makes creepy noises
Olive oil works 

### Too big hole in your wall
Fill it with a tissue/Zewa and put some gypsum on it

### Never know whether the bathroom is being used or not
Construct a basic circuit with a LED and design it to light up when the door is locked 🏮

### Your boss stalks you on GitHub
Pay for GitHub and make your repos private
